What is Java?
Java is a pure object oriented programming language.

Object like human being, bike, car, etc.

Java provides a functionality known as WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
It is a platform independent programming language.

Java is mainly used for developing:-
1)Mobile based applications
2)Desktop applications
3)Web based applications
4)Gaming applications
5)Cloud based applications

Key features of Java:-
Java provides various key functionalities like:
	A very huge library for code optimization
	Auto memory cleanup process i.e Automatic garbage collection
	Platform independent (JVM provides virtual env. to run Java programs that makes it platform independent.)
	Code reusability
Java is simple
Portable
Object oriented -> Inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism
Secure/Robust
Multi-threaded (Multiple tasks to share same memory)
High performance
Dynamic
JDBC (An API for connecting Java program with a database)

Key differences between Java and C++
Java does not support pointer. C++ supports pointer concept.
Header file is not required. Header file is required.
It is purely object oriented (OOP) language. It is only an extension of OOP language.
WORA. WOCA (Write once, complie anywhere)
Java supports multithreading concept. C++ does not support any built-in function for the same.
